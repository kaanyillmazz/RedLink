# About
This project was implemented with React and Metarial ui. Created with node.js. For Database I used Mockend and Axios. Mockend doesn't let server side changes so all changes to database are client side. To start first build the project from dependancies. For Redux version without Axios check here: [BLink](https://github.com/kaanyillmazz/BLink).

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Learn More

You can learn more in the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started).

## KNOWN BUGS
- Default sorting doesn't work
- UI only updates after you hover over an item
- Link submit doesn't really take url (because of mockend limitations)
- you can like and dislike indefinitely
