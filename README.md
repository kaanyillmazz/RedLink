# About
This project was implemented with React and Metarial ui. \
Created with node.js. For Database I used Mockend and Axios. \
Mockend doesn't let server side changes so all changes to database are client side. \
To start first build the project from dependancies. \
For Redux version without Axios check here: [BLink](https://github.com/kaanyillmazz/BLink). \


## KNOWN BUGS ON THIS VERSION
- Default sorting doesn't work
- UI only updates after you hover over an item
- Link submit doesn't really take url (because of mockend limitations)
- you can like and dislike indefinitely
