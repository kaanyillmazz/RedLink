# About
This project was implemented with React and Metarial ui. For Database I used Mockend and Axios. Mockend doesn't let server side changes so all changes to database are client side.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

# KNOWN BUGS
## Default sorting doesn't work
## UI only updates after you hover over an item
## Link submit doesn't really take url (because of mockend limitations)
## you can like and dislike indefinitely
